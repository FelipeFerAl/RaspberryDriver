## Description:

This project implements a character device driver in the form of a Linux Kernel Module (LKM) to control a GPIO-connected LED on a Raspberry Pi. The module allows user-space programs to interact with the LED by writing '1' or '0' to turn it on or off, respectively. It also supports reading the current LED state.

## Learning Objectives: 

- Understand the architecture of Linux character device drivers.
- Learn to register and expose kernel modules through device files.
- Implement GPIO control within the Linux kernel.
- Design user-space applications that interact with device files.
- Apply sound software engineering practices, including documentation, testing, and version
control.

## Features: 
- Custom character device with open, read, write, and release operations.
- GPIO pin configuration and handling using gpio_request, gpio_direction_output, and gpio_set_value.
- Clean module initialization  with proper resource management.
- Debug messages via printk().
